## üß† Project Summary

**VitalCare GPT** is a domain-specific multi-role chatbot platform that utilizes fine-tuned language models hosted on Hugging Face to assist users in three medical domains:

- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Doctor:** Diagnosis & clinical guidance  
- ü•ó **Nutritionist:** Meal plans & dietary advice  
- üíä **Pharmacist:** Medication and dosage information

Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive user interface and trained via the **Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem**, this project demonstrates how multiple LLMs can be orchestrated in a single application based on user context.

## üöÄ Features

- üß¨ **Fine-Tuned Medical Models**  
  Multiple transformer-based language models hosted on Hugging Face:
  - `PastelMed`
  - `LynxMed`
  - `NeuraMed`
  - `SkyeMed`
  - `ClixMed`

- üìã **Role-Specific Spaces**  
  Each space uses domain-specific prompts and keyword validation for accuracy:
  - Doctor, Nutritionist, Pharmacist

- üí¨ **Chat-Like GUI in Streamlit**  
  Real-time text generation using `pipeline()` with history tracking for each space.

- üß† **Custom Model Training & Upload**  
  Notebook provided for fine-tuning custom transformers and uploading to Hugging Face.

## üóÉÔ∏è Project Structure

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                         # Streamlit app with role-based LLM chat
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt              # Project dependencies
```

---

## üîß Setup & Installation

> Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Ahmed-Rayyan/VitalCare-GPT.git
cd VitalCare-GPT

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## üìä Model Fine-Tuning

All training is performed using Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries in the included notebook.

### `Model_Training_&_Upload.ipynb` Includes:
- Loading and inspecting datasets
- Using tokenizer & model
- Preprocessing and training
- Saving and uploading models to Hugging Face Hub

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting on Hugging Face

Once the model is trained and saved, it can be uploaded to your Hugging Face model hub using:

```python
from huggingface_hub import HfApi

api = HfApi()
api.upload_folder(
    folder_path = "./fine_tuned_model",     # Folder where model is saved
    repo_id = "username/model-name",        # Your Hugging Face repo name
    repo_type = "model"
)
